# Atari Punk Synth

Make your next album with our next generation music maker device! Using simple electronic components, we have copied the original and well known Atari Punk Console synthesiser to make this unique "cheap-box" musical synth. With 4 buttons and a joystick ( which acts like a whammy bar) you can now create your own "daft-punk" styled album. No musical talent required!
